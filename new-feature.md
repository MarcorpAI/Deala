🛍️ "Add to Cart" & "View Cart" – Conversational Guide
🔧 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

1. Define a "Cart" or "Saved Items" system

    Create a model/table that links saved products to a specific user or session.

    Store key product details: title, price, image, URL, timestamp.

2. Attach unique identifiers to each AI-search result

    Number the results or embed unique item references so the assistant can refer to them later (e.g., “item 2”).

🧠 Phase 2: Intent Recognition Logic

3. Build a system to interpret “cart” related user commands

    Recognize phrases like:

        “Add item 2 to cart”

        “Save that one”

        “Bookmark the third result”

        “Can you keep this for me?”

        “Save the one with the frother”

    Map those to product index in the latest response list.

4. Build a system to detect cart retrieval requests

    Catch intents like:

        “Show my cart”

        “What have I saved?”

        “Show me saved items”

        “List what I liked so far”

Your AI should know when to query the database for saved items, then summarize and show results back.
📦 Phase 3: Memory and Session Management

5. Store product lists temporarily per user/session

    After every product search, save the result list somewhere in memory (Redis, cache, DB, etc.).

    This enables follow-up commands like “save the third one” or “add the black one” to work.

6. Associate saved items with persistent identity

    If logged in, save to user ID.

    If anonymous, tie to a session ID or temporary token.

🖼️ Phase 4: UI & Manual Add-to-Cart Option

7. Let users also save items manually via buttons

    Beside each result, add a button (🛒 or “Save”) that triggers the same backend function as the voice/command path.

8. Create an API or backend endpoint for viewing saved items

    Could be a standalone page: /my-cart or /saved

    Or could be invoked purely via prompt like:

        “Can I see what I saved earlier?”

🗑️ Phase 5: Optional Extras

9. Add ability to remove items or clear cart

    Detect commands like:

        “Remove the first one”

        “Clear my cart”

        “Forget all saved products”

10. Enhance with categories/tags

    Allow users to say:

        “Save this as a gift idea”

        “Tag this coffee maker for later”

    Gives users more nuanced control and organization.
