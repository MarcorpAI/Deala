1. Session-Aware Memory

What to implement:

    A lightweight in-memory or DB-backed structure to store:

        The last product category searched (e.g., coffee maker)

        Filters (e.g., under $100)

        Returned products (IDs, names, or summaries)

        Keywords the user used previously

Why: This allows the assistant to know what the user was talking about in follow-ups.
2. Query Intent Analyzer

What to implement:

    A function (analyze_intent) that inspects current user input and returns:

        intent: search, refine, compare, ask_followup, rank, etc.

        referenced_context: whether this refers to previous search

        persona: (optional) infer target use-case like “programmer”, “gamer”

my  LLM provider(GROQ) with few-shot examples to do this.
3. Context Resolver

What to implement:

    A middleware (or step in your logic) that:

        If the current intent is not a fresh search, fetch previous context from memory

        Merge previous product list, filters, and categories with the new query

        Clarify with the user if the reference is ambiguous

4. Smart Product Ranker

What to implement:

    A ranking function that:

        Takes product list + user’s new persona (e.g., “programmer”) or follow-up need

        Uses GPT or a ruleset to score/rank those products for that use-case

        Responds like: “The [XYZ Model] is best for programmers because it’s compact and quiet.”

5. Product Comparison Logic

What to implement:

    If the user says things like “which one is better” or “compare the first and third”:

        Fetch product IDs or names from last result

        Use GPT or a script to compare key specs (price, feature, brand, pros/cons)

        Respond in natural language

6. Conversational Response Generator

What to implement:

    Instead of replying with raw search results:

        Generate human-like, contextual summaries

        E.g., “Here are a few options under $100. Based on your follow-up, the ABC model might be ideal for programmers.”

Use templated prompting or fine-tuned model output.
7. Clarification Handler

What to implement:

    If the user gives an ambiguous message (e.g., “Is this good?”):

        Check if there's a valid product reference in memory

        If not, reply with something like: “Just to confirm — are you referring to the coffee makers I showed earlier?”

8. Conversation Controller

What to implement:

    A master logic controller that decides:

        Should I do a new search?

        Should I re-rank previous results?

        Should I compare products?

        Should I clarify?

This is the brain — it connects the other parts based on the intent and context.
9. Optional: Natural Language Filter Refiner

What to implement:

    Let users refine results using messages like:

        “Show me only black ones” → applies color filter

        “I want something faster” → adjust based on product speed metrics

Use your context + keyword detection or a small LLM call to translate that into filters.
10. Logging & Debug View (Dev-only)

What to implement:

    Temporarily log what the assistant:

        Thinks the intent is

        Believes the context to be

        Plans to do next

Why: So you can test if it’s "thinking" right before acting dumb again 😄
